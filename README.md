##Code for the Mixed Messaged project

Hi, the js file aliengreeting.js contains the Javascript for the Mixed Messages project with Codecademy.
It includes:
*Some comments about the project, format, order it's written in (arrays then functions)
*The code itself, including a function call and some logs to draw a very basic alien face of my own creation.

Feel free to run it and play around and provide any feedback.
Enjoy.
